    <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
    <p>Often called Arroz con Leche, this is a sweet custard-like pudding.
       I haven't had a single person not love this traditional Mexican 
       rice pudding. You might want to double the recipe!
    </p>
    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup uncooked long-grain white rice</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 cups water</li>
      <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
      <li>⅔ cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>½ cup raisins (Optional)</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring the rice, butter, and water to a boil in a large saucepan 
          over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 
          until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Whisk together 2 cups of milk, flour, sugar, egg, and vanilla extract 
          in a bowl, and pour the milk mixture over the cooked rice. Stir to combine, 
          and simmer over low heat for 15 minutes. Stir in 1 cup whole milk, the cream, 
          raisins, and cinnamon until thoroughly mixed, and allow to cool for a few minutes. 
          Serve warm or cold.
      </li>
    </ol>
